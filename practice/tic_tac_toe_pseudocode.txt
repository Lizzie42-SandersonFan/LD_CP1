LD 2nd Tic Tac Toe Pseudocode

- first thing is to declare and initalize variable. These will be displayed in the board and can be changed depending on user and computer choices
BOX1 -> 1
BOX2 -> 2
BOX3 -> 3
BOX4 -> 4
BOX5 -> 5
BOX6 -> 6
BOX7 -> 7
BOX8 -> 8
BOX9 -> 9

- Next is to establish our board, likely as a variable sho that we don't have to write it out every time. This will contain both the dividers and BOX variables by using an f string
BOARD -> f""" {BOX1} | {BOX2} | {BOX3} (first row)
----------  (Divider between rows)
 {BOX4} | {BOX5} | {BOX6}  (second row)
---------- (Divider)
 {BOX7} | {BOX8} | {BOX9}  (Last row)"""

- Now we set up a loop that will run the game using while
loop (while): True
    display the BOARD
    - use input to ask which box the user will play in. USER_CHOICE
    - Check if choice is valid using if
    if USER_CHOICE != 1 or USER_CHOICE != 2 or USER_CHOICE != 3 or USER_CHOICE != 4 or USER_CHOICE != 5 or USER_CHOICE != 6 or USER_CHOICE != 7 or USER_CHOICE != 8 or USER_CHOICE != 9:
        - tell the user that their choice is invalid and to try again using continue to get back to the top of the loop
        continue
    else:
        - Our else statment will run if the user picked a valid box. Now we use more if and otherwise statments to figure out which box they picked and ajust the board to account for it
        if USER_CHOICE == 1:
        - This sees if user picked one, now we check if it is avaliable
            if BOX1 != 'X' or BOX1 != 'O':
                - Now we change BOX1 Value to user's symbol (X) if it IS avaliable
                BOX1 -> 'X'
            else:
                - If the box is unavalible, we tell the user and their turn is skipped
                display "You can't play there, your turn has been skipped"
        or if USER_CHOICE == 2:
