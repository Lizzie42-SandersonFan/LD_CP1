# LD 2nd Idiot Proof

#Create a program that takes in a users name, phone number and GPA. The program should change the inputs to be formatted correctly for their type (First and last name capitalized, all other letters lower case, phone number with spaces 000 000 0000, and GPA as a float rounded to 1 decimal place.) 

# Minimum of 5 user inputs (all stored in separate variables)
# 3 separate inputs need to be created
# inputs need to have string methods to ensure that they are formatted correctly
# Output needs to display the users name, phone number and email address) 
# If a user types in something incorrectly make them answer the same question again until they type in a valid input for that question.
