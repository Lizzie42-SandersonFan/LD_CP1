        time.sleep(delay)

startingRoom:

miniBossFight()
    LOOP for mini boss:
        User goes first. Call user attack function

finalBossFight()
    Display monologue moment

VARIABLES
dealy = 0.06 <- for typing print magic, connected to a function
user_health = 30
user_armor = 15
full_health_potions = 0
GOD_GIFT = False
GIFT_OF_FIRE = False
arrows = 0
moves = {
    sword : 10 damage
    *any other weapons the user picks up*
    *if the user decides to use the bow, make sure to subtract 1 from arrows*
}
opening = "long backstory giving context"
closing = "this is what will be shown if user wins and laves the cave system"
*there are more variables, they are jsut local variables for each function, but there are more!!*

RUNNING THE GAME
while loop to run the game:
    type print the opening
    call startingRoom()
    /\ after calling that, the entire game should run on its own. only way to find out is to write code and test tho
    After exitRoom() is all done, display closing via typing thing
    ask user if they want to play again, if they do: continue
