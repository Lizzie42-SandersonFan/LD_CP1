# LD 2nd Order Up Practice

# Build a dictionary with menu items
menu = {
    "cookies_one": ["Milk Chocolate Chip", "Dirt Cake", "Raspberry Lemonade", "S'mores", "Chocolate Cake Batter", "Lemon Bar", "Birthday Cake"],
    "cookies_two": [],
    "cookies_three": [],
    "cookies_four": [],
    "cookies_five": [],
    "cookies_six": []
}

# Dictionary that is the item selected and its price
# This dictionary will slowly be built up through if statements to see what the user ordered

# If statements that will ask the user what they want based on the menu dictionary
# Should do some while loops to asked again if option is invalid

# Print out order and final price
